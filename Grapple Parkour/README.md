# About
**This is the GODOT 4 version of this plugin.
If you're looking for the GODOT 3 version, please go [here](https://github.com/SirRamEsq/SmartShape2D/tree/Godot3-latest)**

This plugin allows you to create nicely textured 2D polys.
Simply place a few points then create / assign the shape material and you should have a good looking polygon.

The textures used are similar to what you would use if making terrain using TileMaps/TileSets
